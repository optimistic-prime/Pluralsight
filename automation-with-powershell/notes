- Remote-Signed should be miminum security permissions
  - Can't set security permissions on linux pwsh
  - Beginning in PowerShell 6.0 for non-Windows computers, the default execution policy is Unrestricted and can't be changed. The Set-ExecutionPolicy cmdlet is available, but PowerShell displays a console message that it's not supported.

- Will look for variables up the scope chain if not found in local scope

- ForEach vs foreach
  - Pipe things to ForEach and it outputs into the pipeline
  - foreach does not go to pipeline
    - foreach used to affect existing variables mostly
  - Seems like ForEach will be better and allow or immutable variables

- $params hash table is super useful for declaring a bunch of variables in a ledgible way.
